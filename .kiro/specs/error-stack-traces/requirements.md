# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the Te Reo Bot's error handling and logging capabilities by adding stack traces to error logs. Currently, when errors occur in the application, the logs may not provide sufficient context for troubleshooting. By including stack traces in error logs, developers and operators will be able to quickly identify the source of errors, understand the call chain that led to the error, and resolve issues more efficiently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want stack traces included in error logs, so that I can quickly identify the root cause of errors and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any part of the application THEN the system SHALL log the error message along with a complete stack trace
2. WHEN an error is logged THEN the system SHALL include file names, line numbers, and function names in the stack trace
3. WHEN multiple errors occur in a call chain THEN the system SHALL preserve the full stack trace showing the error propagation path

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want consistent error logging format, so that I can easily parse and analyze error logs for monitoring and alerting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error is logged THEN the system SHALL use a consistent format that includes timestamp, log level, error message, and stack trace
2. WHEN stack traces are logged THEN the system SHALL format them in a readable way that clearly separates each stack frame
3. WHEN errors occur in different packages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent logging format across all components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want stack traces to be configurable, so that I can control the verbosity of error logging in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of stack trace logging through environment variables
2. IF stack trace logging is disabled THEN the system SHALL log only the error message without stack traces
3. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL enable detailed stack traces by default
4. WHEN running in production mode THEN the system SHALL allow operators to enable or disable stack traces based on operational needs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want stack traces for HTTP handler errors, so that I can troubleshoot API endpoint issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP handler encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error with stack trace and include request context (method, path, headers)
2. WHEN middleware encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error with stack trace before returning HTTP error responses
3. WHEN panic recovery occurs in HTTP handlers THEN the system SHALL log the panic with full stack trace and return appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN errors occur in HTTP handlers THEN the system SHALL NOT include stack traces or internal error details in HTTP responses sent to clients
5. WHEN returning error responses to clients THEN the system SHALL provide only generic error messages that do not expose internal system information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want stack traces for background service errors, so that I can troubleshoot issues in word selection, social media posting, and storage operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN word selection logic encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error with stack trace
2. WHEN social media posting fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with stack trace and include relevant context (platform, message content)
3. WHEN Google Cloud Storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL log the error with stack trace and include operation details (bucket, object, operation type)
